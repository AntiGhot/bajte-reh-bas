BRB : Bajte Reh Bas : An Appsmith template which can be used to develop an Audio Streaming App, currently based on Spotify Web API 

<br>
This is just a reference example for developers when :

- building an Appsmith App
- working with Spotify Web APIs
  

<br>

> Also, You **must not** offer Audio Preview Clips as a standalone service or product. 
[Check Spotify Developer TnCs](https://developer.spotify.com/policy/#v-widgets-and-audio-preview-clips)

> So, **Don't** make the app that you create on Appsmith as public. [Ref](https://docs.appsmith.com/advanced-concepts/access-control#public-apps)
